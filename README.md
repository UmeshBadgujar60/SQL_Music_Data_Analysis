# SQL_Music_Data_Analysis
First, I import data from SQL, including 11 tables from CSV files, and define a primary key for the entire dataset. 
I then establish referential integrity by implementing foreign keys to maintain data consistency.

Next, I transfer the data to Power BI using the Power Query tool and the import wizard. 
I perform data cleaning by modifying data types as required, replacing values, removing null entries, and eliminating duplicate records. 
Once the data cleaning process is complete, I load the refined dataset into Power BI.

Within Power BI, I begin by reviewing the dataset in the Table View to ensure accuracy. 
Subsequently, I switch to the Report View to develop various visualizations for data analysis and reporting.
